# Mastering ASP.NET Web API
This is the code repository for [Mastering ASP.NET Web API](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-aspnet-web-api), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
ASP.NET Core provides a very innovating approach to build web APIs. In this book, you will learn about the ASP.NET Core anatomy, creating web APIs by exploring the concept of middleware, integrating with databases, applying various security mechanisms, and
consuming them in popular web UI frameworks.
This book is written considering both experienced and new developers. A prior knowledge of developing web APIs will be an added advantage, but itâ€™s not a prerequisite. It will help you build a truly cross-platform ASP.NET Core Web API and master it. We are using .NET Core 2.0 Preview 2 and ASP.NET Core 2.0 Preview 2, along with Visual Studio 2017 Preview 3 at the time of writing this book, and we do plan to update this book for the final release of ASP.NET Core 2.0.
